# Brusselator References

### Spatial dynamics near a codimension-two point

A. De Wit, D. Lima, G. Dewel, P. Borckmans

- The bifurcation scenarios that can be obtained in one-dimensional systems near cxdimension-two Turing-Hopf point

### Turing pattern formation in the Brusselator system with nonlinear diffusion

G. Gambino, M. C. Lombardo, M. Sammartino, and V. Sciacca

- The process of pattern formation both in one- dimensional and two-dimensional spatial domains
- Giving a small radially symmetric perturbation of the uniform equilibrium at the center of a square domain, "target patterns" with decaying amplitude are observed

### Periodic traveling-wave solution of Brusselator

Beiye Feng

- $\mu = b - 1 - a^2$
- $x - Vt$

- $V > 0$: we should interchange the stable and the unstable as it stlands in the results of below, but the existence of the limit cycle is still true

### Qualitative research of Brusselator equation in Bio-chemistry

Yuanxun Qin, Xianwu Zen

- $V = -1$: for $\mu >0$ there existsa unique limit cycle which is globally orbitally asymptotically stable, and for $\mu \leq 0$ there does not exist any limit cycle.
